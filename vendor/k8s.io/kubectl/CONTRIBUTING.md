# Contributing guidelines

## How to become a contributor and submit your own code

See [this doc](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-cli/CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to contribute code.

Currently (q2/2017), this repository exists for issue tracking and code mirroring only, and is not accepting code contributions. It will open for code contributions when migration of kubectl code from the kubernetes/kubernetes repository to this repository has been completed.
